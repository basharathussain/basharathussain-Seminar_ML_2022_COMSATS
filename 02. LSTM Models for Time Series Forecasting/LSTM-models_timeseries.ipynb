Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[[103.26338]]\n"]}],"source":["# univariate convlstm example\n","from numpy import array\n","from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.layers import LSTM\n","from keras.layers import Dense\n","from keras.layers import Flatten\n","from keras.layers import ConvLSTM2D\n"," \n","# split a univariate sequence into samples\n","def split_sequence(sequence, n_steps):\n","\tX, y = list(), list()\n","\tfor i in range(len(sequence)):\n","\t\t# find the end of this pattern\n","\t\tend_ix = i + n_steps\n","\t\t# check if we are beyond the sequence\n","\t\tif end_ix > len(sequence)-1:\n","\t\t\tbreak\n","\t\t# gather input and output parts of the pattern\n","\t\tseq_x, seq_y = sequence[i:end_ix], sequence[end_ix]\n","\t\tX.append(seq_x)\n","\t\ty.append(seq_y)\n","\treturn array(X), array(y)\n"," \n","# define input sequence\n","raw_seq = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]\n","# choose a number of time steps\n","n_steps = 4\n","# split into samples\n","X, y = split_sequence(raw_seq, n_steps)\n","# reshape from [samples, timesteps] into [samples, timesteps, rows, columns, features]\n","n_features = 1\n","n_seq = 2\n","n_steps = 2\n","X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], n_seq, 1, n_steps, n_features))\n","# define model\n","model = Sequential()\n","model.add(ConvLSTM2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(1,2), activation='relu', input_shape=(n_seq, 1, n_steps, n_features)))\n","model.add(Flatten())\n","model.add(Dense(1))\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')\n","# fit model\n","model.fit(X, y, epochs=500, verbose=0)\n","# demonstrate prediction\n","x_input = array([60, 70, 80, 90])\n","x_input = x_input.reshape((1, n_seq, 1, n_steps, n_features))\n","yhat = model.predict(x_input, verbose=0)\n","print(yhat)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPGBO2ozRexRrLx+ITrwIgw","collapsed_sections":[],"name":"LSTM-models_timeseries.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
